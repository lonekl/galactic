usage:
	./manage [TASKS]
	Tasks are pointer by single letters. Additionally flags, their options, are put in square brackets: [ ... ].
	Here are some short examples:
		./manage bi
		Which simply builds project, and packs it into a disk image.
		./manage b[release]ir
		Which builds project with maximum optimalisations, again, packs it into a disk image, and then starts optimilised build in qemu.
		./manage g[abort=task]r[memory=1GIB]
		That time 'g' is used, it isn't normal task, it's a way to set more generic values. Abort option with „end.task” value tells to jump on another task, after current one fails.
		'r' runs, by default – development build in qemu, with 1 GIB memory assigned.
tasks:
	h – Display this help message. Can be used only once, and alone.
	b – Build whole project.
		release – Build project for everyday used, optimalised.
		arch=*  – Chose architecture for which project is going to be build.
		          Note, that it will affect next tasks.
		          Possible values are: x86_64.
	i – Pack built project onto a disk image – in `target/disk.img` by default.
		size=SIZE         – Size of disk image to spit out. Default is 4MIB.
		partition table=* – Partition table to create image with.
		                    Possible values are: mbr.
		release           – Whenever to burn optimised built.
		arch=*            – Chose architecture of build to burn.
	r – Run project in Qemu.
		memory=SIZE – Size of random access memory, default is 64MIB.
		arch=*      – Architecture to run.
	g – Generic – is not regular task, used for general configuration.
		abort=* – Hints on how to abort program and it's tasks. Possible values are:
		          all   – Aborts everything on any error. Default value.
		          task  – Aborts only current tasks, continuing next ones.
		          rest  – Continues current task where possible, and aborts next ones.
		          never – Aborts as rarely as possible.
