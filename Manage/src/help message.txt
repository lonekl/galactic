usage:
	./manage [TASKS]
	Tasks are pointer by single letters. Additionally flags, their options, are put in square brackets: [ ... ].
	Here are some short examples:
		./manage bi
		Which simply builds project, and packs it into a disk image.
		./manage b[release]ir
		Which builds project with maximum optimalisations, again, packs it into a disk image, and then starts optimilised build in qemu.
		./manage g[abort=end.task]r[memory=1GIB]
		That time 'g' is used, it isn't normal task, it's a way to set more generic values. Abort option with „end.task” value tells to jump on another task, after current one fails.
		'r' runs, by default – development build in qemu, with 1 GIB memory assigned.
tasks:
	h	Display this help message.
	b	Build whole project.
	i	Pack built project onto a disk image – in `target/disk.img` by default.
	r	Run project in Qemu.
	g	Generic – is not regular task, used for unspecified configuration.
